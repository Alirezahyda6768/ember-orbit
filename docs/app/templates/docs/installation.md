# Installation

As with any Ember addon, you can install EO in your project with:

```
ember install ember-orbit
```

EO depends on `ember-auto-import` to automatically import external
dependencies, including `@orbit/coordinator` and `@orbit/memory`.

The generators for orbit sources and buckets will attempt to install any
additional orbit-related dependencies.
